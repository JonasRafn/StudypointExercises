Question 1: 
2 threads are created, both threads will call the same method "next()" in the "Even" class
because the threads are running at random times, they might call the method at the same time.
The result, is that 1 of the threads might call the method, and then stop before it finishes,
the method resulting that the integer "n", might only be incremented once. When the other 
thread, calls the method it increments "n" by 2 and the integer is no longer even. 

Question 2: 
This problem is very common when developing multithreaded applications, and is definetly 
something that needs to be dealt with. In the world of banking it would be catastrophic,
if the register wasn't correctly balanced at the end of the day.
