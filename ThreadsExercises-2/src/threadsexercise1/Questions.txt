Question 1:
        After running the timings i have noted that on my pc it is faster to run the, methods sequential
        rather than running it paralel. When i started doing the timings i was expecting, running it paralel,
        would be faster than sequential. There is multiple factors, that could be the raeson for this. 
        It all depends on the specs of the pc, it might be faster on my pc, but slowe ron another. 
        It may be the other way around tomorrow, maybe even later in the day.
